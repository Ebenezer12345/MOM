        <P>In a world full of fleeting moments and shifting tides, there remains one constarnt in my life-my
            mother, my heroine She is the quiet force behind every achievement, the gentle nudge when I falter
            and the unwavering support when the world feels heavy. Her love is not just a feeling but a force.
            powerful and enduring, shaping who l am and who I strive to be.
            From the carliest memories of my childhood, she was there-strong, resilient, and always
            present. Itwasn't just the meals prepared, the clothes neatly folded that made her remarkable. It was the
            way she dideverything with love, even when tired, even when the world seemed too much
            Her sacritices are too many to count, yet she never once complained. She taught me that strength
            isn't just in muscle or power but in perseverance, in doing what needs to be done without expecting
            praise or recognition. She showed me that true courage is in the quiet battl es, the ones fought every day
            in the shadows, with no audience but oneself.
        </P>

        <P>It is her smile, her laughter, and the way she lights up a room that reminds me of the beauty in
            simplicity
            She taught me that life isn't about the grand gestures but the small, everyday acts of kindness and
            love
            She lives with a grace that is rare, a grace that I can only hope to emulate.
            To my mother, my heroine, thank you. Thank you for being the foundation of my strength, the
            source of my inspirati on, and the embodiment of un conditional love. Everything I am and everything I
            will ever be, lowe toyou. You are my guiding star, my safe harbor, and my greatest treasure.
            lam proud to be your child, and I hope to live a life that makes you proud in return. Your legacy is
            not just in the lessons you've taught me but in the love you've given me -a love that will continue to
            shape my life and the lives of those around me.
            For all that you are and all that you've done, I love you more than words can express. You are my
            heroine, now and always.
            Rest on My Heroine
